/**
 * Interface to be implemented by mappable validators.<br>The validator is the central point of the validation
 * framework. It implements the whole chain of validation, from the triggers, till the display of the feedback.<br>Upon
 * validation trigger (for example, whenever the user enters some data in a field, presses an Apply button, etc.), data
 * is retrieved (for example, from the input field, a database, etc.) and passed to the validation algorithm (for
 * example, expecting data to be entered in a specific format), which produces validation results (for example, invalid
 * input, valid input, input too long, misspelled, etc.), which are then used to give appropriate feedback to the user
 * (for example, a popup dialog, an error icon, etc.).<br>A mappable validator allows to map triggers to data providers,
 * data providers to rules, and rules to result handlers.<br>It can be used, for example, to build validation of a group
 * of components.
 *
 * @param <T>   Type of trigger initiating the validation.
 * @param <DP>  Type of data provider providing the input data to be validated.
 * @param <DPO> Type of data provided by the data providers.
 * @param <R>   Type of validation rules to be used on the input data.
 * @param <RI>  Type of data the rules will check.
 * @param <RO>  Type of result the rules will produce.
 * @param <RH>  Type of result handlers to be used on validation output.
 * @param <RHI> Type of result the result handlers will handler.<br>It may or may not be the same as RO depending on the
 *              implementations.<br>For instance, an implementation could aggregate/transform the results before using
 *              the result handlers.
